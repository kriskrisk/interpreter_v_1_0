# Interpreter for the language C-H

C-H is a language designed by me as a university project. It's similar to C in terms of syntax. The main difference is that C-H is interpreted rather than compiled. Furthermore it is a scripting language. This project is an interpreter for language C-H. Examples of syntax can be found in `.in` files in `good` directory.
